# Password Generator Starter Code

This is a password generator that takes the user input for length and characters included provided
by the user to create a random string.

The issue that I'm running into is getting the password to include more than just the first substring of characters (if the user selects to include uppercase characters, the password is made
up only of uppercase characters, even if they choose to include other groups as well).
